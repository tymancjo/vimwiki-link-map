# The Vimwiki Link Map
This is a simple procejt that is my attempt to ceate mind map like graph crator for wim viki systems.

## The story

As I started to use Vimwiki to crate all my notes and in general try to work on system of a "second brain" I noticed that with the standard markdown notation that I prefer to use I cant easily display all connections (links) in the notes as a mind-map.
More less like it is in the Obsidian app, which seem to be really cool, except it cant be used in terminal :(


To overcome this - This is my attempt to create an app that will add such functionality.
